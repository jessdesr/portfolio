      <p>
        As a software developer with 3 years of experience working in the fast-paced world of startups, my skills have been sharpened on the job, where I learned to design robust, flexible, and beautiful software to meet complex and varied requirements.  In my previous position as a software engineer at Control, a small FinTech startup in Vancouver, I thrived in a small team working to build features quickly and efficiently.

        I am a champion for improving the development process and project management practices so.  In my opinion, a good development process can be the difference between a well-oiled machine and a hectic, unproductive environment.  My experience with Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming has taught me that finding the right process can be key to the success (or failure!) of a product.

        Iâ€™m currently freelancing and experimenting with new technologies while I pursue new opportunities. Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or through my e-mail!
